# 📌 Project Management System

A modern, full‑stack project management application that helps teams organize projects and tasks. Built as a **monorepo** using **npm workspaces** for seamless development of both the React frontend and the Express backend.

---

## 📖 Description

This system provides a complete solution for managing projects and associated tasks. Users can:

- Register / log in securely (JWT authentication)
- Create, edit, soft‑delete, and restore projects
- Create, edit, delete, restore tasks (with status: pending, in progress, completed)
- Filter and paginate through projects and tasks
- View dashboard statistics (total projects, tasks, completed/pending/in‑progress tasks)
- Update profile information (name, username)
- Permanently delete account (with all related data)
- Automatic session expiry handling (redirect to login)

The frontend is built with **React**, **TypeScript**, **TanStack Query**, and **Tailwind CSS**.  
The backend is a **REST API** built with **Express**, **MongoDB**, **JWT**, and **Joi** validation.

## 🖥️ Frontend

### ✨ Features

- User authentication (login / register) with protected routes
- Dashboard with key metrics
- Projects management:
  - List all projects (paginated, search by title, show/hide trashed)
  - Create, edit, soft‑delete, restore project
  - Restore all tasks of a trashed project
- Tasks management:
  - List tasks filtered by project, status, title, and trashed state
  - Create, edit, soft‑delete, restore task
  - Task status badges (pending, in progress, completed)
- Profile page:
  - View and update name / username (email is read‑only)
  - Delete account with confirmation modal
- Responsive dark/light theme (default dark)
- Reusable components: `Pagination`, `ConfirmModal`, `ProjectFormModal`, `TaskFormModal`, `Filters`
- Debounced search (800ms) to avoid excessive API calls
- Toast notifications (`react‑hot‑toast`)
- Session expired interceptor – auto logout on 401 / custom 500 message

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites

- Node.js **18+** (npm 9+ recommended)
- MongoDB instance (local or Atlas)

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-management-system.git
cd project-management-system
2. Install dependencies (from root)
```bash
npm install
This will automatically install dependencies for both backend and frontend workspaces.

3. Set up environment variables
Backend (backend/.env):

env
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/pms
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_key_here
Frontend (frontend/.env):

env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api/v1
4. Run in development mode
From the root directory:

bash
npm run dev
This starts both the backend and frontend concurrently.

Backend: http://localhost:5000

Frontend: http://localhost:5173 (default Vite port)

To run each separately:

bash
npm run dev:backend   # only backend
npm run dev:frontend  # only frontend
5. Build for production
bash
npm run build
Then start the built applications:

bash
npm run start:backend
npm run start:frontend
6. Default test user
If the backend seeds initial data, you can log in with:

Username/Email: testuser@example.com (or use the registration form)

Password: password123

📡 API Endpoints (Backend)
All endpoints are prefixed with /api/v1.
